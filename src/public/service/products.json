    "description": "These high-voltage transformers are particularly used for connecting grids at different voltages. If voltage levels are close, autotransformers provide economical advantage. Ä°n autotransformers, measures should be taken particularly against short circuits. Three-phase and single phase autotransformers up to 550kV, 500MVA, produced in BEST plants, have also successfully completed short circuit tests and they have been in operation since their first introduction in the grids.",
